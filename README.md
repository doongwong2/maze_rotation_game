# maze_rotation_game
a 2d game I've developed using unity 2D  

Library file not included to reduce file size.  

To Open:  
1. Unzip the source code.
2. Open a fresh Unity Project(2021.3.1f1 Version).
3. Open the located Unity Project File.
4. Delete everything except the Library File.
5. Move the Unzipped source code in step 1 into this file.
6. Now you have the game running in Unity3D.
